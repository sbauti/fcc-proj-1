                    Gandhi traveled to London to study law at University College. This period marked his exposure to Western ideas, vegetarianism, and the Bhagavad Gita's teachings.</li>
                <li><span class="dark">Transformation in South Africa (1893–1915)- </span>
                    As a young lawyer in South Africa, Gandhi faced racial discrimination, which led him to develop and practice nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha, for social justice.</li>
                <li><span class="dark">Return to India (1915)- </span>
                    Gandhi returned to India, becoming a central figure in the struggle for independence. He advocated for Swadeshi goods, self-reliance, and rural development.</li>
                <li><span class="dark">Champaran Satyagraha (1917)- </span>
                    Gandhi led his first significant Indian protest in Champaran, Bihar, fighting for indigo farmers' rights against exploitative British landlords, marking a turning point in India's freedom movement.</li>
                <li><span class="dark">Salt March (1930)- </span>
                    Gandhi led the Dandi March, a 240-mile walk to protest British salt taxes. It became a powerful symbol of nonviolent resistance and self-sufficiency.</li>
